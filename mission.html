    <p class="lead" style="font-weight:400;font-size:20px">Hi there!<br>The reason this software is free is because it should be. Now that sounds like the worst sentence ever put together but hold on, I'll try to explain.
    <br><br>I've personally tried to use several web scrapers that advertise themselves as free on the internet. Unfortunately, many of these come with a catch. Many of these catches involve a limited number of
    projects or web scrapers that you can deploy. You can get rid of these issues simply by paying for a plan. Many of these plans range from $30 all the way up to $500. Since my family isn't very rich, 
    my only option at this point was to learn how to code a web scraper myself. It took a day or two to even start writing a line of code. It took a further two weeks to be able to confidently code a scraper without running into huge problems.
    <br><br>Due to all of these issues, I wanted to make something publicly available with no catches. Now this might seem to good to be true, and that's because it kinda is. I personally don't have enough testers or
    Google engineer level programming so there will be issues and bugs which you can report (send me a DM or mention me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeyScrape" target="_blank">here)</a>. Apart from that, there isn't any malware or hidden fees. It's a completely free piece of software that you can use for commercial or non-commerical purposes.<br><br>
    If you are financially stable and able to donate, it will never go unappreciated. Every donation will help and I mean it.<br> You can donate <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>Thank you for reading this :)</p>
